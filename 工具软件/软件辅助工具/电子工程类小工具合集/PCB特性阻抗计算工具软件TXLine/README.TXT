The following is the latest information on TXLine.



Installation
_________

To reduce the size of the TXLine files, no setup program is provided. However setting up the program is very simple. All the files extracted from the TXLINE.ZIP file need to be in the directory that the program will be executed from. If you want to create an icon for the program, then you need to manually add the program item through the Windows Program Manager (or through Explorer in Windows 95/98/NT/2000). Consult your Windows documentation for adding program icons to the Program Manager.

Also, after the first time the program is ran, a file named txline.ini will be created in the directory the program is located in.  This file saves the state the program was in when it was last used.
